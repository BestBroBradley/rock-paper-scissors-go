# Rock, Paper, Scissors - GO!

Rock, Paper, Scissors - GO! is a purely front-end game which allows the user to select from one of three options and play against the computer.  It uses time delays to delay the computer's choice, and keeps track of the user's win percentage until they refresh the page.

This app is a fun game, which is slightly addicting and takes only a few moments for each round.
